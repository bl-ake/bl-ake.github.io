This paper proposes a mixed-integer programming (MIP) framework that constructs exact, optimization-based explanations for graph neural networks. By encoding the GNN and structural constraints into a MIP formulation, we obtain globally optimal explanation sets that are faithful to the model and interpretable to practitioners.
